Precision audio tools for bass players

We specialise in creative, useful blocks for Darkglass Anagram, designed by bassists for bassists. 

4 columns of product cards or groups of products cards:

Practice in the box (Cognate Metro, Cognate Drums, Cognate Chords)

Synth bass (Cognate Bass Synth, Cognate Animus)

Studio sound live (Cognate Forge, Cognate Hologram)


Blocks
Please make a product list page in categories (Practice in the Box, Synth Bass, Studio Sound Live)

Then a page per product

Please make a template product page that I can use to onboard new products.

These will all be available in the Anagram store - we don't need a shopping cart, install button etc, just a link to Anagram Store for each product

For each product, we will need a product shot, header paragraph, description, additional shots, youtube promo video, youtube walkthrough video, link to Anagram Store.

Can you mock up a product shot of Anagram running each plugin with a background:

Cognate Metro (a free metronome, use a classy wooden metronome on a grand piano as background)

Cognate Drums (a drum machine, use an old Ludwig drumkit as background)

Cognate Chords (a chord backing generator, use a tampura, an acoustic guitar, a fender rhodes as background)

Cognate Forge (a multiband compressor, use blacksmith/metal foundy imagery as background)

Cognate Bass Synth (a bass synth, use a Moog Minimoog, an Arp 2600, a Roland TB-303 as background)

Cognate Animus (a wavetable resynthesiser, use wavetables, waterfall displays of waveforms as background)

Cognate Hologram (a stereo processor and modulation tool, use a binaural head, a pair of headphones, studio monitors as background)
